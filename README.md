# game-tracker
My first CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) console application written in C#

# Requirements:
- [x] Create a database called GameTracker.db if one doesn't exist already
- [x] Provide the user with a main menu to navigate
- [x] Allow user to insert, read, update and delete entries
- [x] User can return to the main menu if needed

# Features:
* Console based user interface
    - ![VsDebugConsole_avNuPbTEkZ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23292290/221282688-23a94555-2f11-4180-8654-0ab9f0238d99.gif)

* Four different menu options
    - View all records, Insert record, Delete record, Update record

* Input validation
    - The user cannot submit more than 59 minutes, or higher than a 5/5 rating for instance

# Challenges:
- This was my first time working with SQL in conjunction with another programming language, so I had to learn a few things (mostly syntactically) to get them working together
- I had a rough time understanding Microsoft.Data.Sqlite, but I was mostly overcomplicating things and after doing a bit of research I understand it better now
